                Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) generalize conventional neural networks to graph-structured data and 
                have received considerable attention owing to their impressive performance. 
                In spite of the notable successes, the performance of Euclidean models is inherently bounded and limited by the representation ability of Euclidean geometry, 
                especially when it comes to datasets with highly non-Euclidean latent anatomy. Recently, hyperbolic spaces have emerged as a promising alternative for processing 
                graph data with tree-like structure or power-law distribution and a surge of works on either methods or novel applications have been seen.  Unlike Euclidean space, 
                which expands polynomially, hyperbolic space grows exponentially with its radius, making it more suitable for modeling complex real-world data. 
                 Hence, it gains natural advantages in abstracting  tree-like graphs with a hierarchical organization or power-law distribution.
    
			   <!-- Graph-structured data are widespread in the real-world applications, such as social networks, recommender systems, knowledge graphs, chemical molecules etc. Despite the success of Euclidean space for graph-related learning tasks, its ability to model complex patterns is essentially constrained by its polynomially growing capacity. Recently, hyperbolic spaces have emerged as a promising alternative for processing graph data with tree-like structure or power-law distribution, owing to its exponential growth property.  Different from the Euclidean space which expands polynomially, the hyperbolic space grows exponentially which makes it gains natural advantages in abstracting tree-like or scale-free graphs with hierarchical organizations.      -->

			This tutorial aims give a systematical review of the methods, 
            applications, and challenges in this fast-growing and vibrant area, with the express purpose of being accessible to all audiences.
            More specifically, we will first give a brief introduction to graph neural networks as well as some preliminary of  Riemannian manifold and hyperbolic geometry. 
            We then will comprehensively revisit the technical details of the developed HGNNs, by unifying them into a general framework and summarizing the variants of each component. 
            Besides, we will introduce applications deployed in a variety of fields. 
            Finally, we will discuss several challenges and present the potential solutions to address them, including some initial attempts of our own, which potentially paves the path for the further flourishing of the research community.
